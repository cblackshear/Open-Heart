# What is the Open-Heart Repository?
The Open-Heart repository was created to provide instantaneous access to the programs developed by the Jackson Heart Study Coordinating Center that translate the raw data collected in the study into an analysis ready data warehouse. Data access policies and procedures can be reviewed on the [Jackson Heart Study website](https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/Research/Study-Data/Data-Access).
