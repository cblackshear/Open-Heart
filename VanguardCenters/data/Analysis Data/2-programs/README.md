# Introduction
These programs are used to create the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at each exam visit. Descriptions of variables contained in the analysis datasets are available in the [Analysis Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAoVWFYKDURl6PUCy5y32ffUUFv54ytZ8H1YuCx9LO4/edit?usp=sharing).

- **analysis1**: these programs are used to create the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 1.
- **analysis2**: these programs are used to create the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 2.
- **analysis3**: these programs are used to create the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 3.
- **analysisLong**: these programs are used to create a long-form dataset (i.e., multiple observations per participant – one per visit)    of the CCDC's derived variables for participants across all visits. 
- **analysisWide**:	these programs are used to create a wide-form dataset (i.e., one observation per participant, but variables reflect a single visit - e.g., there is BMIV1, BMIV2, and BMIV3) of the CCDC's derived variables for participants across all visits. 

- **validation1**: these programs are used to perform QC on the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 1.
- **validation2**: these programs are used to perform QC on the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 2.
- **validation3**: these programs are used to perform QC on the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 3.

# How to Use
The 0-0 RUNanalyses file runs the other programs for creation of the analysis datasets.
