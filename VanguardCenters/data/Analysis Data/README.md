# Introduction
These programs are used to create the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at each exam visit. Descriptions of variables contained in the analysis datasets are available in the [Analysis Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAoVWFYKDURl6PUCy5y32ffUUFv54ytZ8H1YuCx9LO4/edit?usp=sharing).

- **analysis1**: these programs are used to create the [CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 1](https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/Portals/0/pdf/analysis1.pdf).
- **analysis2**: these programs are used to create the [CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 2](https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/Portals/0/pdf/analysis2.pdf).
- **analysis3**: these programs are used to create the [CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 3](https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/Portals/0/pdf/analysis3.pdf).
- **analysisLong**: these programs are used to create a long-form dataset (i.e., multiple observations per participant – one per visit)    of the CCDC's derived variables for participants across all visits. 
- **analysisWide**:	these programs are used to create a wide-form dataset (i.e., one observation per participant, but variables reflect a single visit - e.g., there is `BMIV1`, `BMIV2`, and `BMIV3`) of the CCDC's derived variables for participants across all visits. 
- **validation1**: these programs are used to perform QC on the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 1.
- **validation2**: these programs are used to perform QC on the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 2.
- **validation3**: these programs are used to perform QC on the CCDC’s derived variables for participants at exam visit 3.

# How to Use
The `0-0 RUNanalyses` file runs the other programs for creation of the analysis datasets.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How are the analysis datasets derived?**
> Variables that have been derived by the JHS CCDC are added to the analysis datasets. Documentation of these datasets is available in the [Analysis Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAoVWFYKDURl6PUCy5y32ffUUFv54ytZ8H1YuCx9LO4/edit?usp=sharing). This analysis data dictionary gives the description and definition of the derived variables as well as the “raw” variables the derivation utilizes. References for definitions, when available, are listed in the “reference” column of the data dictionary.
